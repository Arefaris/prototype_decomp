# Engine worklist

Open items in the engine units that are already started. Addresses are PROTOPC_2025.

## camera/director.cpp (0x107DD9D0 - 0x107DEAA0)

- `0x107DDB80` (`ret 0xC`) and the one-byte `ret` functions at `0x107DDC30` - `0x107DDC60`: empty functions whose
  owner is unknown (probably default virtuals of camera classes).
- `Director::Update` 98.6 %, `~Director` 93.7 %, `StartTransition(Name)`: EQUIVALENT (see the source comments).

## system/enginememory.cpp (0x107DEAC0 - 0x107DF3A0)

- `0x107DECD0` (heap kind name) takes its argument in `eax`, and `OnAllocFail` (`0x107DED20`, not in
  functions.tsv, about 0x1D6 bytes) calls it that way. MSVC 2005 only gives static functions a register convention
  under link-time code generation (`/GL`), so neither can match with plain `/O2`.
- `0x107DEAC0`, `0x107DEAD0`, `0x107DEF40` (`ret`) and `0x107DEF30` (`return 0`): owners unknown.

## controller/inputsystem.cpp (0x107DF3B0 - 0x107E059A)

The unit is complete except for these EQUIVALENT functions:

- `PushContext` / `PopContext`: the context count is addressed `[index + base]` where the engine has
  `[base + index]`.
- `Update`: the tail call goes through `edx` where the engine uses `eax`.
- The constructor: in the last loop the engine keeps `i` in `ecx` and stores `contexts` after the first compare.
- `UpdatePlayers`, `StopVibration`, `SetManager`: register choice or a reload the engine makes.
- `UpdateRemote`: the engine inlines finder / remover helpers that our compiler declines to inline (inline budget);
  the hand-expanded loops differ in load order.
- Unreferenced kept copies not reproduced yet: `0x107DF450` (`bool` at 0), `0x107DF460` (`operator==` of a 4-byte
  value), `0x107DF4D0` (`InputSystem::GetControllerCount`, declared but unused).

Lesson: inline accessors whose kept copies sit in the unit were used by the unit's code. Writing the code through
them (instead of the field expressions) changes inlining and register allocation; `SetFactory` only matched once
it used `GetInput` / `SetInput`.

## system/poimanager.cpp (0x10825AF0 - 0x10826776)

Complete except two EQUIVALENT functions: the `WorldStreamerPOI(GameObjectHandle)` constructor (the engine keeps
the handle serial in memory for the table check) and `WorldStreamerPOI::GetPosition` (the engine checks the handle
twice, IsValid then Get; our build folds the second check). Lessons from this unit:

- `math::Vector` has a user-defined copy constructor (copy construction is `fld` / `fstp` per component) and a
  `(x, y, z)` constructor (a by-value `Vector(x, y, z)` argument is built in place with `movss`).
- `GameObjectHandle`'s own constructor is inline over a base whose constructor (`0x107EE330`) is out of line:
  callers take the temporary's address again after the call instead of using the returned `this`.
- The engine's asserts keep a per-site `static bool` and pass file, line, expression text and message to
  `core::ReportError` (`OLD_ASSERT_AT` in `code/core/debug.h`).

## gameobject/details/mastertable.cpp (0x107E1D20 - 0x107E2420)

Complete except `Allocate`, `Move` and `Replace` (EQUIVALENT: register choice; Move / Replace merge the count copy
into one xor / and / xor insert where the engine keeps SetCount's and / or). Not reproduced yet: the kept copies
`0x107E1E20` (Entry::GetObject), `0x107E1E80` (GameObjectHandle::GetSerial), `0x107E1EB0` (ArrayFixed constructor),
`0x107E1F30` / `0x107E21C0` (empty) and `0x107E2400` / `0x107E2410` (ArrayFixed Clear / Reset) are not emitted
because nothing in the unit uses them. `0x107E2420` is the out-of-line MasterTable constructor (matched). `0x107EE340` is HandleBase's
(index, serial) constructor. Lesson: a `bool` inline returning a bit-field compiles to `shr; test` in conditions,
an `unsigned int` one to `test mask`.

## gameobject/behaviour.cpp (0x107EE450 - 0x107EEBBA)

Complete (47 functions with the reflection templates). Lessons:

- The reflection library (`code/content/metatype.h`): each reflected class builds its meta types in function-local
  statics (`GetPrimitiveMetaType<T>`, `GetMemberMetaType<C, T>`) and a member table; the type codes are short string
  literals ("p", "pn", "n"). PrimitiveMetaType<T>'s twelve content-library slots are declared only and mapped in
  symbols.txt to the incremental link thunks the engine's vftables hold (objcmp checks vftable words against them).
- A setter given as a pointer to a virtual member produces the compiler's vcall thunk (`??_9Behaviour@...`), which
  the engine kept as a function of the unit.
- Template members defined outside the class without `inline` are called, not inlined (BitField); their bit index is
  an int shifted as `1 << (unsigned char)bit`.
- A `bool` result written as `x == y ? true : false` drops the `xor eax, eax` before `sete`.

## gameobject/gameobjectsystem.cpp (0x107EEBC0 - 0x107F09D0)

In progress. Done: handle and registration helpers, iteration, creation, deferred updates, handle operations,
InitGameObjectSystem, ReleaseReadyGameObjects, the shutdown, FindGameObject / SearchGameObject, the channel functions
(GetListeners, SendMessage, PostMessage, CountListeners), plus the kept copies of the container, iterator, LoadInventory
and MessageRouter helpers. EQUIVALENT: SendMessage / PostMessage / CountListeners (the engine keeps the handle
iterator in a register and copies the end iterator every round), GetGameObjectName (the serial is compared again for
Get after IsValid), MoveHandle (the engine resolves the handle twice),
ClearGameObjectSystem (the engine loads gDeferredObjects before storing the router's list end) and
ShutdownGameObjectSystem (its inlined ArrayDynamicHeap destructor keeps the loaded begin pointer; a local copy in the
destructor fixes it but breaks `container::Destroy<MessageListenerList>`). Also UpdateGameObjects (0x107F0410). Left: `Iterator::Next<GameObject>`
(0x107EF2E0: the engine does not jump-thread the null result of the inlined NextObject) and small kept copies.
Lessons:

- The "update group" is content::LoadInventory (RTTI); game objects are LoadObjects kept by name, and the names are
  core::Name references.
- container::ArrayFixed keeps its elements in raw storage, not `T data[N]`: with a real array the compiler destroys
  all N elements in the array's destructor, and the engine's destructors only destroy [data, end).
- A constructor that tests its bool parameter (not the member it stored) lets the compiler drop the test for a
  constant argument; the engine's locked LoadInventory::Iterator has a separate one-argument constructor.
- A dead loop (`while (bit != 0x400) bit <<= 1;` with an unused result) is left in by the compiler.
- UpdateGameObjects takes a 12-byte context by value (the callers copy three words); the time step is its last word.
  Reading the object again for an argument (`GetHandle((GameObject*)it.entry->GetObject())`) instead of reusing the
  local fixed the register allocation of the whole loop.
- A function with more than a page of locals calls `__chkstk` (the engine's `__alloca_probe`, 0x10A883B0); it is
  mapped in symbols.txt.
- `__RTDynamicCast` is an import stub (0x10A88356); leave it out of symbols.txt, the relink takes it from
  msvcr80.lib. The RTTI type descriptors `??_R0...@8` it is passed are mapped as data.

## gameobject/gameobject.cpp (0x107E05A0 - 0x107E1D20)

First part: the constructor, destructor and scalar deleting destructor, vftable slots 0 - 5 (AddRef / Release
forward to LoadObject, slot 3 registers the object, IsReady, slot 5 ends construction), the construction helpers
(heap and object in thread-local slots), SendMessage / PostMessage, SetTransform / SetPosition, the controller
forwards, FindAttribute, SetActive, AddAttribute and AddDynamicAttribute. EQUIVALENT: RemoveDynamicAttribute (the
engine saves esi / edi before testing for the list). Second and third parts: the reflection data (GetClassInfo
and GetMembers of AttributeEntry, DynamicAttributeList and GameObject), the content meta type getters (class, name,
object and ArrayDynamic meta types), MemberOffset, the MetaInstanceHelper / ArrayDynamicHelper templates and the
ArrayDynamic<AttributeEntry> members they use. Left: 0x107E1CD0 (sends AttributeUpdatedMessage), 0x107E1500
(Compact), the uninitialised copy / fill helpers and a few duplicate one-instruction copies. Lessons:

- The "behaviour container" is engine::BehaviourController (RTTI); its 64-bit listen mask is at +0x20 and the update
  mask at +0x28.
- content::LoadObject's reference count is volatile: the LoadObject vftable store survives in the GameObject
  constructor only because the volatile store after it stops dead-store elimination.
- Members set in the constructor before a member object's constructor call are in the initialiser list.
- Placement new on a "room for one more" helper (`new (array.Grow()) T(...)`) gives the engine's null-checked
  in-place construction; Size / Capacity are signed (`sar`) and a capacity read once into a local keeps the shifts.
- `x ? false : true` gives `test; sete` where `!x` gives `neg; sbb; add`.
- Vftable slots a class inherits without overriding are mapped to the incremental link thunks the vftables hold.
- content::MemberOffset is a template on the member type (MemberOffset<unsigned char> is 0x10568950,
  <core::Name> 0x10066120); each new member type gets a copy in the unit that first uses it. Templates defined in a
  header without `inline` stay calls, so the meta type getters (GetClassMetaType<T>, GetObjectMetaType<T>,
  GetNameMetaType<Key>, GetArrayDynamicMetaType<Owner, A>) are templates; a plain inline getter gets inlined.
- The real container is container::ArrayDynamic<T, Allocator> (RTTI); ArrayDynamicHeap<T> is the
  AllocatorCoreAligned<16> instance. Size / Capacity are unsigned.
- A function-local static with a destructor registers it with `_atexit` (0x10A882DA, mapped in symbols.txt).

## scenariomessage.cpp (0x107F09D0 - 0x107F1960)

Complete (76 functions): engine::ScenarioMessage's GetHandle / SetHandle / WriteEvent, the WriteFields and Clone of
the engine's scenario messages (NullMessage, ScenarioInitializeMessage, StringMessage, the trigger, object, NIS and
stream package messages), TriggerMessage's and StringMessage's constructors, the trigger messages' reflection data
and every kept copy (constructors, destructors, scalar deleting destructors, base class casters). The file name is a
guess (no assert path). Lessons:

- Slot 1 of a scenario message copies it into caller memory: placement new of the class's ordinary constructor, then
  the handles, as many as the class's handle info (20-byte statics at 0x111BD558 + 0x14 n) says.
- The meta type getters are templates on the owning class (GetNameMetaType<EnterTriggerMessage>, ...), so every
  class gets its own copy.
- A class whose base has a reflected type stores its base meta type and a content::BaseClassCasterImpl<B, D> in its
  MemberList (members +8 / +0xC).
- `if (a == 0) return false; if (!b) return false;` keeps both early-out branches where `a == 0 || !b` merges them.

## gameobject/behaviourcontroller.cpp (0x108390F0 - 0x1083AD20)

engine::BehaviourController, the GameObject's behaviour list (the GameObject member `behaviours` at +0x20): construction
and destruction, the per-message dispatch table shared through a pool of reference-counted tables, the update pass
mask and per-behaviour schedule (time slicing, frame skip, phase), message listening masks, message handling,
removal, type queries and the reflection data. UpdatePasses and UpdateBehaviours are equivalent; everything else
matches. The file name is a guess (no assert path). Lessons:

- The schedule entry's flags are bitfields (13 pass bits, updated, scheduled, active) in a union with the 16-bit
  word; a set written as `if (x) bit = 1; else bit = 0;` gives the engine's `or` / `and` pair.
- Branches the compiler tail-duplicates need the same locals assigned in both arms, or it merges them.
- `dt = updateTimeScalar * dt` (reusing the parameter) keeps the engine's single stack slot.
- Parameters the callers push without extension (`push al`) are `unsigned char`, not bool.
- GameObject::IsRegistered is out of line: the controller calls a copy at 0x107E0780 instead of inlining it.
- The controller overrides Behaviour's slot 0 (0x1083AC70, called by GameObject::Slot5 when construction ends): it
  compacts the behaviour list through a range-constructed copy and a swap (container::CompactSwap; `copy.Swap(array)`,
  not `array.Swap(copy)`), moves the schedule and message masks into the construction heap with container::Swap,
  then gives every behaviour its slot 0. Without the override the game crashed while loading although every
  function matched: tools/vtcheck.py now compares vftables.

## gameobject/gameobjectspawner.cpp (0x107F22C0 - 0x107F27D0)

engine::GameObjectSpawner: builds game objects from a content::MetaObjectTemplate (slot 9 of the template) in a heap,
adds them to an inventory, stamps the template's name into their "meta object template" attribute and, on request,
takes them off the message channel of their "packageName" attribute. Complete except two EQUIVALENT functions:
the constructor (the transform address is computed before the reference count store) and the main Create (stack
slot sharing: the engine packs the heap statistic, the attribute lookup and the handle into one slot and puts the
attribute writer at +8; that looks like 8-byte alignment of core::Name, which the other users lay out at 4).
`0x107F27D0` (`mov eax, [ecx]`, unreferenced) is not placed yet. Lessons:

- A pointer-or-default argument written as `if (p == 0) p = global;` before the call compiles to `cmove`; the
  ternary inside the argument list gives a branch.
- Attribute access goes through out-of-line templates of other units (GetAttributeWriter<T> 0x10081FE0, whose
  writer sends AttributeUpdatedMessage from its destructor through 0x107E1CD0, and GetAttributePtr<T> 0x1006AD60)
  wrapped by an inline GetAttributeValue<T>: the struct temporary dies inside the wrapper, which is what lets the
  engine reuse its stack slot.
- The message router's "value" is a channel (const MessageListeners&, a core::Name); RouterAdd / RouterRemove /
  RouterQuery were retyped.
- A meta type getter's static caster vftable is checked as a constant: leave an inline template's slot functions
  unmapped when the original vftable holds incremental link thunks for them.

## online/onlinelua.cpp (0x107F27E0 - 0x107F2970)

The script helper online_DeterminePlayerIndex and the questions behind it (CharacterQueryPlayerControlStateMessage,
the input slots' local ids), with the unit's script registration. Three EQUIVALENT functions: IsLocalSlot (`sete`
into the masked register) and the two handle helpers, which hit the open IsValid-then-Get problem: the engine
compares the handle's serial again for Get, our build folds it (also poimanager.cpp; `IsValid() { return Get() != 0; }`
does not change that). Tested in game: `online_DeterminePlayerIndex(PLAYER_1)` answers 0. Lessons:

- Units register script functions with ScriptContext::SetOwner(&static), Register<R, A>(name, function) (out of line
  per instantiation, in other units) and ClearOwner; Unregister(&static) removes them. ScriptContext moved to
  code/engine/scriptcontext.h.
- `GetScriptContext()->Unregister(x)` pushes the argument before the call; the engine calls first, through a named
  local.

## physics/supportinglimb.cpp (0x107F2970 - 0x107F66E0), first part

SupportingLimbDefinition (reflected loader object, 21 members), SupportingLimbDefinitionList, SupportingLimb (state of
one limb) and SmoothingVelocityMap: reflection, constructors, destructors, copy / swap, SetDefinition and the
explicitly instantiated containers (container::ArrayCDynamic<T, N>, an inline array of N with an end pointer, and
the new[]-based array the RTTI calls ArrayDynamic<T, AllocatorNew>, kept here as container::ArrayDynamicNew).
Six class functions are EQUIVALENT (see the source). Open:

- Container members that do not match yet (left unmapped, the engine's copies stay): ArrayDynamicNew::Create /
  Allocate / Erase / Reserve / Insert, ArrayCDynamic Erase / ShiftUp / Insert (Entry), the UninitializedFill and
  CopyRange copies, the helpers' Insert / Erase. Mostly register allocation.
- 0x107F3020, 0x107F31A0, the empty functions 0x107F2F40 / 0x107F31E0 - 0x107F3200 / 0x107F3CC0 - 0x107F3CE0: owners
  unknown (more identical copies than names).

Second part (runtime, 12 functions: 7 match, 5 EQUIVALENT): the cast input / result structs (CastInput 0x58 bytes:
ignore word, frame, down, start offset, extra length; CastResult 0x28 bytes, constructed with 1e12 / -1 / 0xff),
CastRay (a ravenphysics segment query from the limb origin along `down`, through the engine's shared hit buffer
0x107E6CD0 / 0x107E3C30 / 0x107E3C20 and `ravenphysics::Context::CastRay` 0x106593A0 on the context 0x1128356C; the
nearest hit whose normal faces the cast within cosineSupportAngleTolerance), Cast (the random rays on a circle of
randomRayCircleRadius around the origin, keeping the nearest), ResetDirection, GetSupportPlane and the free helpers
SmoothValue, SmoothDirection, CrossAxes, AlignAxis, OrientAxes (ORIENTATION_AXIS: axis % 3 is the matrix row, axis / 3
the sign; the third axis of a pair comes from a 3x3 table). The physics library's types live in
`code/ravenphysics/context.h` (the definition's properties plus the word behind them are one 12-byte
IntersectionFilter, copied whole into the query). Validation (2026-10-12): free roam, sprint, jump, fight, teleport.

| Address | Guess | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0x107F2B20 | GetSupportPlane | EQUIVALENT: end point computed x, z, y in the engine (y as length * normal.y) |
| 0x107F3560 | AlignAxis | EQUIVALENT: axis in esi / direction in ecx in the engine, ecx / edx in ours |
| 0x107F36C0 | SmoothDirection | EQUIVALENT: load order of the direction and the dot product's sum order |
| 0x107F5540 | CastRay | EQUIVALENT: this in edi and an 8 byte larger frame in the engine |
| 0x107F5AC0 | Cast | EQUIVALENT: result flag in bl in the engine, the two matrices swapped on the stack |
| 0x107F5D20 | Update | EQUIVALENT: the engine calls its kept copy of SmoothingVelocityMap::IsEmpty (0x107F3210), ours inlines it |

Update (2.4 KB) casts for a move of the character from the previous to the current frame (a second, predicting cast
from the new frame when the first finds the ground beyond the resting length), turns the random rays that found
nothing, smooths the limb's length (SmoothValue with the velocity map or the linear / fractional limits) and its
direction (SmoothDirection towards the surface normal), orients the character frame (OrientAxes / AlignAxis against
the up vector) and finally moves `current` across the cast direction so that the limb's end stays on the support.

**Bug found on 2026-10-12 (since part 1):** every character fell over sideways in the hybrid. The cause was the class
key: the original's RTTI names `.?AUSupportingLimbDefinitionList@engine@@` (a struct), ours was a class, and the
game's `dynamic_cast` (LoadInventory::DynamicCaster) compares type names, so the cast to the list returned null and
no character got its limb definitions. Byte matching and the slot check cannot see this; vtcheck now compares the
class key of every vftable's RTTI type too (it found 20 more, fixed in the same commit).

**Second bug (same day): pedestrians sank to their knees.** CastRay stored the input's word into the query's flags
(+0x24, which must stay 3) instead of the filter's last word (+0x20): a `mov [esp+0x78]` right after a `push` is
`[esp+0x74]` of the frame. Alex's limbs still found the ground, the pedestrians' did not. Found with a differential
build: the original CastRay kept, ours compiled under another name, Cast calling both and logging every difference.
Count the pending pushes when reading stack stores; an EQUIVALENT function is only as good as that reading.

Matching notes: a `Set(a, b, c)` call (arguments evaluated before any store) is what makes a cross product load all six
components first; component-wise row stores through a `Vector&` to the matrix row give the engine's pointer forms;
`Clamp(t, 0, 1)` sometimes becomes a different branch layout than two explicit `Select`s; `-v` is `-0.0f - x` (subss).

Lessons:

- Runs of tiny unreferenced functions are explicit instantiations (`template class X<...>;`): every member gets a copy.
- The member meta type getters are one instance per member (PrimitiveMetaType / VectorMetaType statics), so the getter
  is a template with an id; use the member index, not __LINE__ (any edit would rename the symbols).
- ArrayCDynamic keeps raw storage: constructing the array does not construct its elements.
- math::Matrix has a user-defined (inlined) copy constructor like Vector's: copies move element by element (movss).
- A loop that leaves through `break` into a bool result (`sorted = false; break;`) matches where `return false` in the
  loop does not.
- scratchpad tool kept2.py (in-process byte comparison) replaces kept.py: seconds instead of an hour.

## motiontrackingfilter.cpp (0x107FC800 - 0x107FE2A6)

engine::MotionTrackingFilter and its reflected filters (Rigid, DampedLinear, SpringBasedLinear, DampedAngular,
SpringBasedAngular): each update moves a tracked transform with its velocities and accelerations (MotionState, 0x74
bytes, name guessed) towards a target transform. Reflection data, constructors, the inline destructors and scalar
deleting destructors, the base class casters, the member meta types, MotionState's constructor and velocity updates
and the rotation delta helper all match (51 functions). The directory and file name are guesses (no assert path).

| Function | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0x107FCEF0 SpringBasedLinearMotionFilter::Update | EQUIVALENT | scheduling: the engine reloads the state's velocity for each use |
| 0x107FD340 DampedAngularMotionTrackingFilter::Update | EQUIVALENT | else branch: axis.y / axis.z loaded into a register where ours multiplies from memory |
| 0x107FD580 SpringBasedAngularMotionFilter::Update | EQUIVALENT | as SpringBasedLinear |

Lessons:

- /fp:fast reorders commutative sums freely: `x*x + y*y + z*z` and `z*z + y*y + x*x` compile alike. The engine's
  `(z*z + y*y) + x*x` length came from math::DistanceSquared(a, b) (Sub into a local, then Dot), not from Dot.
- A position read as a by-value temporary (`Vector p(m.m[3][0], m.m[3][1], m.m[3][2])`) loads all three components
  into registers first (reg-reg subtracts); writing the field expressions folds the loads into the arithmetic.
- `Vector& acceleration = state.linearAcceleration; acceleration.Sub(...); acceleration.Scale(dt);` reproduces the
  engine's load / multiply / store per component where the same calls on `state.linearAcceleration` let the compiler
  hoist the loads. A reference local for the velocity fixed DampedAngular's first branch the same way.
- fabsf of a value then multiplied stays on x87 (`fabs; fmul`); the engine stores the fabs results first (a separate
  Vector of magnitudes), then multiplies with SSE.
- `float dt = step.dt;` as a plain copy becomes an x87 `fld / fst` spill; using `step.dt` in the expressions keeps one
  SSE load.
- Inline virtual destructors in the class body are inlined into the scalar deleting destructor and still emitted as
  7-byte COMDATs (the engine's unreferenced `mov [ecx], base vftable; ret` copies); out-of-line ones are called.
- An `angle > pi` fold-back negating the axis (`axis = -axis`) needs all three negations computed before the stores
  (a temporary Vector), not Set(-x, -y, -z) or three assignments.

## database/gamedatabase.cpp (0x107F6B30 - 0x107F9F49)

engine::GameDatabase (the RTTI name; the engine's earlier "Console" guesses for it are renamed): the named subjects
(int, float, string and wide string values per player) the scripts, the front end and the online helper read and
write, kept in a `container::Map<unsigned __int64, DBSubject*, AllocatorCoreStatic<0x80,16>>` keyed by the name hash.
The unit has the subject API, the input / online / storage / front end callbacks, profile building, the db_* script
functions (registered through engine::Function wrappers, `MethodN` / `ClosureN`, and the inline
`ScriptContext::RegisterMethod` templates) and Create / Destroy. 60 functions match, plus 111 kept copies (the
method wrappers, the registration templates, the inline callback base members, the Map / SList members and the
scalar deleting destructors). The file name is a guess (no assert path); DBSubject, OnlineGameDBHelper,
GameDBStorage and GameDBHelper live in other units and are only declared.

| Function | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0x107F6C50 FindPlayer | EQUIVALENT | register choice and block layout: the engine saves edi on entry and keeps the player in edi |
| 0x107F6E30 StorageSlot3 | EQUIVALENT | the engine adds the member offset to ecx before loading the vftable |
| 0x107F6E40 StorageSlot4 | EQUIVALENT | as StorageSlot3 |
| 0x107F71F0 SetIntValue | EQUIVALENT | the engine spills `scope == 1` to a stack slot before pushing the arguments |
| 0x107F72B0 SetFloatValue | EQUIVALENT | as SetIntValue |
| 0x107F7380 SetStringValue | EQUIVALENT | as SetIntValue |
| 0x107F8DB0 BuildProfile | EQUIVALENT | `add eax, -4` where ours has `sub eax, 4` |

Unreferenced kept copies not reproduced: 0x107F6FB0, 0x107F6FE0, 0x107F70A0, 0x107F7170, 0x107F7180, 0x107F7190,
0x107F75C0, 0x107F75E0, 0x107F7600 (small Map / SList / allocator members whose exact form is unknown).

Lessons:

- The script wrappers read their arguments one after another (`A1 a1 = *(const A1*)arguments++; ...`) in a static
  `Call(object, arguments, result, method)`, and `ClosureN::Invoke` calls `MethodN::Invoke(object, ...)` explicitly;
  the result is stored only `if (result != 0)`.
- `RegisterMethod` is an inline member template defined out of the class; the engine emits it as a kept copy per
  instantiation, next to the wrappers' members.
- Template members defined out of the class without `inline` (core::Name's hash constructor and GetHash) are
  emitted as calls, but the optimizer still knows they are pure: repeated GetHash calls are merged and hoisted.
- Lookups copy the map pointer into a local first (`SubjectMap* map = subjects;`) and name the found subject
  (`DBSubject* subject = it->value;`) to get the engine's load order.
- SList needs its (empty) allocator member: sizeof 0x10, which the engine's SList::Size loop and `new` sizes show.
- `ResetSubject` / `ResetInt` / `ResetFloat` reset the subject twice (engine behaviour, kept).

## system/streampackage.cpp (0x107F9F50 - 0x107FBE3C)

engine::StreamPackage (RTTI; a reflected MetaLoadObject with slotGroup, prerequisites, resources, tags, sync,
xenonMaxSize, inventoryInitialSize) and its run-time half, StreamPackageInstance (name guessed, 0xA0 bytes): the
nine-state load machine over engine::streampackagestates (states and their transition table in this unit, the
states themselves in another), the inventory, the resource loaders and the stream clients. 58 functions match, plus
63 kept copies (the lists' members, StringDynamic, the string / primitive meta type getters and setters, the member
meta type getters, the scalar deleting destructors). The directory and file name are guesses (no assert path). The
reflected setters of tags / sync / inventoryInitialSize were folded by the linker with identical functions of other
units (0x104E13C0 / 0x104E13D0 / 0x104E13E0), so they are compiled but not annotated.

| Function | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0x107F9FA0 StreamPackageInstance::Update | EQUIVALENT | the engine adds the state to request * 9 as a memory operand and reloads it for the comparison |
| 0x107FA050 StreamPackageInstance::CreateInventory | EQUIVALENT | register choice in the AddRef call |
| 0x107FBC90 StreamPackage(const Name&) | EQUIVALENT | scheduling of the reference count store |
| 0x107FBDC0 StreamPackage() | EQUIVALENT | as the other constructor |

Unreferenced kept copies not reproduced: 0x107FA240 / 0x107FA260 / 0x107FA280 (`mov eax, ecx`), 0x107FA2A0 /
0x107FAF40 (a cdecl `if (p) *p = value`), 0x107FAE40 / 0x107FAE70 (`mov eax, [ecx]`) and the one-byte `ret`s.

Lessons:

- StringDynamic's constructor is inlined into `new String(name)` but not into `new String(text, StreamAllocator())`:
  one in-class constructor with a defaulted allocator argument gives both call sites; a separate out-of-class
  template constructor for the explicit form was not needed.
- A countdown that reads `[base + i*4 - 4]` and then `[base + i*4]` after the decrement is `while (i-- != 0)` with
  both accesses at `[i]`, not `[i - 1]` / `--i`.
- Find-and-erase loops that keep the end pointer in a register across the erase need a local end that is reloaded
  after the erase (`end = list.end;`), placed before any following push.
- A state machine loop that keeps a constant in ebx came from writing `request = REQUEST_NONE` on both paths (the
  compiler merges the stores and hoists the constant), not from a goto.
- `bool active = false; if (...) active = call(); return active;` gives the engine's `xor al, al` before the test and
  a tail jump.

## audio/audiomessage.cpp (0x107FE2B0 - 0x107FE508)

engine::AudioEmitterTriggerMessage::Apply (vftable slot 1 of the RTTI class; the messages' other members live in
another unit): finds or creates the emitter's sound, plays / stops it ("play" / "stop" with three modes) and sets
its min / max distance, pitch range and volume. The audio emitter, its sound list and sounds are only declared. Apply
is EQUIVALENT (99.4 %: the engine computes the volume parameter table pointer in eax, ours in ecx); three kept
accessor copies match. Not reproduced: 0x107FE2B0 (`lea eax, [ecx + 0x20]`) and 0x107FE2E0 (forwards
`this + 0x10` to 0x1087D7F0 of its argument).

Lessons:

- A by-value argument built with `sub esp, 8; mov ebx, esp; call ...; copy` is constructed in place by an inline
  converting constructor that itself makes the call (here a hash struct built from a core::Name); converting first
  and copying pushes the words instead.
- Float tests written `0.0f != x` / `1.0f != x` load the constant into the register (`xorps` / `movss` then
  `ucomiss reg, [mem]`); `x != 0.0f` loads the member instead.

## system/streamtrigger.cpp (0x108352B0 - 0x10836640): done (75 functions: 73 match, 2 equivalent)

engine::StreamTrigger (RTTI; reflected members neighbours, packages, hulls, boundingBox, tags): a world volume (box,
refined by StreamTriggerHull plane hulls) for the stream manager; neighbours and packages are ';'-separated name lists
held as `container::StringDynamic<AllocatorCoreStatic<12,16> >` and resolved (ResolveLinks, through the manager's
lookups 0x1082E090 / 0x1082E010) into arrays of triggers / packages. 21 class functions plus 54 kept copies (the
explicitly instantiated hull and plane arrays, the hull array's ArrayDynamicHelper, StringMemberGetSetter and the
per-member string meta type getters). Both constructors are EQUIVALENT (the reference count is cleared before the
name's address is computed in the engine, after in ours; same as SupportingLimbDefinition). Validation (2026-10-12):
free roam, long teleports, pedestrians normal.

New shared pieces: `code/container/arraydynamicstatic.h` (a partial specialisation of container::ArrayDynamic for
AllocatorCoreStatic<Heap, Align>: begin / end / capacity plus the empty allocator, 16 bytes; Create = bool, Allocate =
void, as the ArrayDynamicNew helpers), `code/content/stringmetatype.h` (StringMetaType, StringMetaTypeGetSet,
StringMemberGetSetter<C>, GetStringMemberMetaType<C, Id>), `code/engine/system/tagset.h` (TagSet, unit 0x108340A0 -
0x108351A0 not reconstructed yet), StringDynamic in `code/container/string.h`, AABB's reflection declarations.

Not mapped (no identical copy of ours): 0x108357C0 (plane AssignRange), 0x10836170 / 0x10836220 / 0x108362F0 /
0x108363A0 (hull array ShiftUp / Reserve / Insert / Insert), 0x10836590 (helper Insert), 0x10836620 (deleting
destructor). Matching notes: free function templates need `inline` to be inlined (/Ob1) — ConstructCopyAt is,
ConstructFill / AssignRange / ConstructCopiesN are not; an empty allocator argument must be a named local (a
value-initialised temporary gets a byte store); loops over a list cache its end before the loop.

## system/tagset.cpp (0x108340A0 - 0x108351A0): open, blocked on core::Name

TagSet (declared in `code/engine/system/tagset.h`): sorted core::Name tags plus an "all" flag; ToString (static
StringC buffer, tags joined), Find / Contains / Remove, Intersects / Includes (merge walks), FromString, an insert by a
comparison function (0x10834D70) and the VS2005 Dinkumware std::sort / lower_bound instances for Name* (`<algorithm>`
from the toolchain would reproduce them). Blocked: several of those instances align their frames (`and esp, -8`)
around local Name copies, which suggests core::Name holds a 64-bit member in the original (our Name is two ints, laid
out with 4-byte alignment by its users). Tried 2026-10-12: `unsigned __int64 key` breaks only the 15 camera functions
(Cinematographer keeps a Name at offset 4); the same inside `#pragma pack(push, 4)` keeps all 2376 matching. Next step:
compile TagSet's std::sort with that Name and see whether the frames get `and esp, -8`.
