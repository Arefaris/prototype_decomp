# Engine worklist

Open items in the engine units that are already started. Addresses are PROTOPC_2025.

## camera/director.cpp (0x107DD9D0 - 0x107DEAA0)

- `0x107DDB80` (`ret 0xC`) and the one-byte `ret` functions at `0x107DDC30` - `0x107DDC60`: empty functions whose
  owner is unknown (probably default virtuals of camera classes).
- `Director::Update` 98.6 %, `~Director` 93.7 %, `StartTransition(Name)`: EQUIVALENT (see the source comments).

## system/enginememory.cpp (0x107DEAC0 - 0x107DF3A0)

- `0x107DECD0` (heap kind name) takes its argument in `eax`, and `OnAllocFail` (`0x107DED20`, not in
  functions.tsv, about 0x1D6 bytes) calls it that way. MSVC 2005 only gives static functions a register convention
  under link-time code generation (`/GL`), so neither can match with plain `/O2`.
- `0x107DEAC0`, `0x107DEAD0`, `0x107DEF40` (`ret`) and `0x107DEF30` (`return 0`): owners unknown.

## controller/inputsystem.cpp (0x107DF3B0 - 0x107E059A)

The unit is complete except for these EQUIVALENT functions:

- `PushContext` / `PopContext`: the context count is addressed `[index + base]` where the engine has
  `[base + index]`.
- `Update`: the tail call goes through `edx` where the engine uses `eax`.
- The constructor: in the last loop the engine keeps `i` in `ecx` and stores `contexts` after the first compare.
- `UpdatePlayers`, `StopVibration`, `SetManager`: register choice or a reload the engine makes.
- `UpdateRemote`: the engine inlines finder / remover helpers that our compiler declines to inline (inline budget);
  the hand-expanded loops differ in load order.
- Unreferenced kept copies not reproduced yet: `0x107DF450` (`bool` at 0), `0x107DF460` (`operator==` of a 4-byte
  value), `0x107DF4D0` (`InputSystem::GetControllerCount`, declared but unused).

Lesson: inline accessors whose kept copies sit in the unit were used by the unit's code. Writing the code through
them (instead of the field expressions) changes inlining and register allocation; `SetFactory` only matched once
it used `GetInput` / `SetInput`.
