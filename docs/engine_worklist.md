# Engine worklist

Open items in the engine units that are already started. Addresses are PROTOPC_2025.

## camera/director.cpp (0x107DD9D0 - 0x107DEAA0)

- `0x107DDB80` (`ret 0xC`) and the one-byte `ret` functions at `0x107DDC30` - `0x107DDC60`: empty functions whose
  owner is unknown (probably default virtuals of camera classes).
- `Director::Update` 98.6 %, `~Director` 93.7 %, `StartTransition(Name)`: EQUIVALENT (see the source comments).

## system/enginememory.cpp (0x107DEAC0 - 0x107DF3A0)

- `0x107DECD0` (heap kind name) takes its argument in `eax`, and `OnAllocFail` (`0x107DED20`, not in
  functions.tsv, about 0x1D6 bytes) calls it that way. MSVC 2005 only gives static functions a register convention
  under link-time code generation (`/GL`), so neither can match with plain `/O2`.
- `0x107DEAC0`, `0x107DEAD0`, `0x107DEF40` (`ret`) and `0x107DEF30` (`return 0`): owners unknown.

## controller/inputsystem.cpp (0x107DF3B0 - 0x107E059A)

The unit is complete except for these EQUIVALENT functions:

- `PushContext` / `PopContext`: the context count is addressed `[index + base]` where the engine has
  `[base + index]`.
- `Update`: the tail call goes through `edx` where the engine uses `eax`.
- The constructor: in the last loop the engine keeps `i` in `ecx` and stores `contexts` after the first compare.
- `UpdatePlayers`, `StopVibration`, `SetManager`: register choice or a reload the engine makes.
- `UpdateRemote`: the engine inlines finder / remover helpers that our compiler declines to inline (inline budget);
  the hand-expanded loops differ in load order.
- Unreferenced kept copies not reproduced yet: `0x107DF450` (`bool` at 0), `0x107DF460` (`operator==` of a 4-byte
  value), `0x107DF4D0` (`InputSystem::GetControllerCount`, declared but unused).

Lesson: inline accessors whose kept copies sit in the unit were used by the unit's code. Writing the code through
them (instead of the field expressions) changes inlining and register allocation; `SetFactory` only matched once
it used `GetInput` / `SetInput`.

## system/poimanager.cpp (0x10825AF0 - 0x10826776)

Complete except two EQUIVALENT functions: the `WorldStreamerPOI(GameObjectHandle)` constructor (the engine keeps
the handle serial in memory for the table check) and `WorldStreamerPOI::GetPosition` (the engine checks the handle
twice, IsValid then Get; our build folds the second check). Lessons from this unit:

- `math::Vector` has a user-defined copy constructor (copy construction is `fld` / `fstp` per component) and a
  `(x, y, z)` constructor (a by-value `Vector(x, y, z)` argument is built in place with `movss`).
- `GameObjectHandle`'s own constructor is inline over a base whose constructor (`0x107EE330`) is out of line:
  callers take the temporary's address again after the call instead of using the returned `this`.
- The engine's asserts keep a per-site `static bool` and pass file, line, expression text and message to
  `core::ReportError` (`OLD_ASSERT_AT` in `code/core/debug.h`).

## gameobject/details/mastertable.cpp (0x107E1D20 - 0x107E2420)

Complete except `Allocate`, `Move` and `Replace` (EQUIVALENT: register choice; Move / Replace merge the count copy
into one xor / and / xor insert where the engine keeps SetCount's and / or). Not reproduced yet: the kept copies
`0x107E1E20` (Entry::GetObject), `0x107E1E80` (GameObjectHandle::GetSerial), `0x107E1EB0` (ArrayFixed constructor),
`0x107E1F30` / `0x107E21C0` (empty) and `0x107E2400` / `0x107E2410` (ArrayFixed Clear / Reset) are not emitted
because nothing in the unit uses them. `0x107E2420` is the out-of-line MasterTable constructor (matched). `0x107EE340` is HandleBase's
(index, serial) constructor. Lesson: a `bool` inline returning a bit-field compiles to `shr; test` in conditions,
an `unsigned int` one to `test mask`.

## gameobject/behaviour.cpp (0x107EE450 - 0x107EEBBA)

Complete (47 functions with the reflection templates). Lessons:

- The reflection library (`code/content/metatype.h`): each reflected class builds its meta types in function-local
  statics (`GetPrimitiveMetaType<T>`, `GetMemberMetaType<C, T>`) and a member table; the type codes are short string
  literals ("p", "pn", "n"). PrimitiveMetaType<T>'s twelve content-library slots are declared only and mapped in
  symbols.txt to the incremental link thunks the engine's vftables hold (objcmp checks vftable words against them).
- A setter given as a pointer to a virtual member produces the compiler's vcall thunk (`??_9Behaviour@...`), which
  the engine kept as a function of the unit.
- Template members defined outside the class without `inline` are called, not inlined (BitField); their bit index is
  an int shifted as `1 << (unsigned char)bit`.
- A `bool` result written as `x == y ? true : false` drops the `xor eax, eax` before `sete`.

## gameobject/gameobjectsystem.cpp (0x107EEBC0 - 0x107F09D0)

In progress. Done: handle and registration helpers, iteration, creation, deferred updates, handle operations,
InitGameObjectSystem, ReleaseReadyGameObjects, the shutdown, FindGameObject / SearchGameObject, the channel functions
(GetListeners, SendMessage, PostMessage, CountListeners), plus the kept copies of the container, iterator, LoadInventory
and MessageRouter helpers. EQUIVALENT: SendMessage / PostMessage / CountListeners (the engine keeps the handle
iterator in a register and copies the end iterator every round), GetGameObjectName (the serial is compared again for
Get after IsValid), MoveHandle (the engine resolves the handle twice),
ClearGameObjectSystem (the engine loads gDeferredObjects before storing the router's list end) and
ShutdownGameObjectSystem (its inlined ArrayDynamicHeap destructor keeps the loaded begin pointer; a local copy in the
destructor fixes it but breaks `container::Destroy<MessageListenerList>`). Left: the update loop 0x107F0410, `Iterator::Next<GameObject>`
(0x107EF2E0: the engine does not jump-thread the null result of the inlined NextObject) and small kept copies.
Lessons:

- The "update group" is content::LoadInventory (RTTI); game objects are LoadObjects kept by name, and the names are
  core::Name references.
- container::ArrayFixed keeps its elements in raw storage, not `T data[N]`: with a real array the compiler destroys
  all N elements in the array's destructor, and the engine's destructors only destroy [data, end).
- A constructor that tests its bool parameter (not the member it stored) lets the compiler drop the test for a
  constant argument; the engine's locked LoadInventory::Iterator has a separate one-argument constructor.
- A dead loop (`while (bit != 0x400) bit <<= 1;` with an unused result) is left in by the compiler.
- `__RTDynamicCast` is an import stub (0x10A88356); leave it out of symbols.txt, the relink takes it from
  msvcr80.lib. The RTTI type descriptors `??_R0...@8` it is passed are mapped as data.
